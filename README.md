## Part 2
You will use the Etherscan API in order to query information available on ETH’s
Blockchain. Please sign up for a free API key and remember to pass in all API
keys via the command line, do not hard-code it into your project file. Make
sure each bullet point is in a separate JS function (3 total).

• How much ETH is in the wallet address:
0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa. 
Also print the value in USD

• How much did Marlon Humphrey (MarlonHumphrey.eth) from the Baltimore Ravens:

<ul>
  <li> Pay for Bored Ape #1880?</li>
  <li> Sell Bored Ape #1880 for?</li>
  <li> Pay for Bored Ape #6112?</li>
  <li> How much did GoldApe.eth pay for Bored Ape #6112 before selling it to Marlon Humphrey?</li>
</ul>

Print the current price of ETH in USD and BTC
Hint: Looking up Block and Transactions hashes using the Etherscan/OpenSea
websites will be extremely helpful for these tasks.

## Part 3
  
To gain some deeper insights on pricing, we will use CoinAPI’s free tier. Please
create two JavaScript functions that output the following pricing data:

  <ul>
    <li> Print the current exchange rates for:
      <ul>
          <li>BTC</li>
          <li>ETH</li>
          <li>SOL</li>
          <li>ADA</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
   <li> Print the price of Bitcoin on:
        <ul>
          <li>March 1, 2020 @ 12am EST</li>
          <li>March 30, 2020 @ 12am EST</li>
          <li>May 1, 2017 @ 12am EST</li>
          <li>Your birthday in 2021</li>
        </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
