## Part 2
You will use the Etherscan API in order to query information available on ETH’s
Blockchain. Please sign up for a free API key and remember to pass in all API
keys via the command line, do not hard-code it into your project file. Make
sure each bullet point is in a separate JS function (3 total).
• How much ETH is in the wallet address:
0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa. Also print the value
in USD
• How much did Marlon Humphrey (MarlonHumphrey.eth) from the Baltimore Ravens:
– Pay for Bored Ape #1880?
– Sell Bored Ape #1880 for?
– Pay for Bored Ape #6112?
– How much did GoldApe.eth pay for Bored Ape #6112 before selling
it to Marlon Humphrey?
• Print the current price of ETH in USD and BTC
Hint: Looking up Block and Transactions hashes using the Etherscan/OpenSea
websites will be extremely helpful for these tasks.
